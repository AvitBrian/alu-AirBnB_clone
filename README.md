# AIR BNB CLONEEEE

## Pre-lude

This will project is all about building a Air bnb clone from scratch.
throughout development we will be looking at several concepts. currently, we're dealing with our very own interprenter to help us manage and maintain our storage system.

### The console

We'll be creating our data model that will help us manage (create, update, destroy, etc) objects via a console / command interpreter.
we'll be able to store and persist objects to a file (JSON file).
The first piece is to manipulate a powerful storage system. This storage engine will give us an abstraction between “My object” and “How they are stored and persisted”.
This abstraction will also allow you to change the type of storage easily without updating all of our codebase.

The console will be a tool to validate this storage engine
